      <description>No No. No you cannot shout me over anything. No you do not have right to criticise me, blame me for stupid things. No you cannot treat me badly for being disorganised or unfocused. I am disorganised and unfocused because of you. I feel bad and ashamed whenever I interact with you. You literally make me feel bad. Now I understand that you did this one purpose, because you hated me for being me feminine.</description>
