# No

No.
No you cannot shout me over anything. No you do not have right to criticise me, blame me for stupid things. No you cannot treat me badly for being disorganised or unfocused. I am disorganised and unfocused because of you. I feel bad and ashamed whenever I interact with you. You literally make me feel bad. Now I understand that you did this one purpose, because you hated me for being me feminine.

No you cannot make jokes about my appearance. No you cannot belittle me. All of those bad words, swearing and profanity proves that you are a disgusting and despicable person. When you told me "you are big enough to solve this" whenever I needed your help proves that.

No, it's not normal not to call a kid for weeks or months. No, it's not normal not reacting and ignoring when your child cries everyday coming from home because of being bullied. No, it's not good to let your kid to be bullied.

No, it's horrible to slander your kid saying that she stole money from neighbour even she does not need any money and she calls you for getting your permission every time when she has to get some money from your bag. When she attempted suicide when she was 16 years old, it's not normal ignoring it and move on like nothing happened.

No it's not normal to go on holiday for 3 months leaving your kid at home when she was 15, because she failed 2 classes in high school.

No, it's not normal to say "you are an adult and YOU need to support me" when she complained why you never call her when she needed your support.

No it's not ok, to protect, support and help financially your SON but when your daughter needs your help to say "go, sell some websites".

You are a disgusting person, everything you done to me as a kid is nothing else than neglect and abuse.

I hate you.
